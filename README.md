Why use LangChain?
LangChain helps developers build applications powered by LLMs through a standard interface for models, embeddings, vector stores, and more.

Use LangChain for:

Real-time data augmentation. Easily connect LLMs to diverse data sources and external/internal systems, drawing from LangChain's vast library of integrations with model providers, tools, vector stores, retrievers, and more.
Model interoperability. Swap models in and out as your engineering team experiments to find the best choice for your application's needs. As the industry frontier evolves, adapt quickly – LangChain's abstractions keep you moving without losing momentum.
Rapid prototyping. Quickly build and iterate on LLM applications with LangChain's modular, component-based architecture. Test different approaches and workflows without rebuilding from scratch, accelerating your development cycle.
Production-ready features. Deploy reliable applications with built-in support for monitoring, evaluation, and debugging through integrations like LangSmith. Scale with confidence using battle-tested patterns and best practices.
Vibrant community and ecosystem. Leverage a rich ecosystem of integrations, templates, and community-contributed components. Benefit from continuous improvements and stay up-to-date with the latest AI developments through an active open-source community.
Flexible abstraction layers. Work at the level of abstraction that suits your needs - from high-level chains for quick starts to low-level components for fine-grained control. LangChain grows with your application's complexity.
LangChain ecosystem
While the LangChain framework can be used standalone, it also integrates seamlessly with any LangChain product, giving developers a full suite of tools when building LLM applications.

To improve your LLM application development, pair LangChain with:

Deep Agents (new!) – Build agents that can plan, use subagents, and leverage file systems for complex tasks
LangGraph – Build agents that can reliably handle complex tasks with LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework. LangGraph offers customizable architecture, long-term memory, and human-in-the-loop workflows – and is trusted in production by companies like LinkedIn, Uber, Klarna, and GitLab.
Integrations – List of LangChain integrations, including chat & embedding models, tools & toolkits, and more
LangSmith – Helpful for agent evals and observability. Debug poor-performing LLM app runs, evaluate agent trajectories, gain visibility in production, and improve performance over time.
LangSmith Deployment – Deploy and scale agents effortlessly with a purpose-built deployment platform for long-running, stateful workflows. Discover, reuse, configure, and share agents across teams – and iterate quickly with visual prototyping in LangSmith Studio.
